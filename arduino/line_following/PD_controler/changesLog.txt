Added a check for the front sensors and set it up so if it was a game turn, or a t-intersection, it would assign the turn direction to the newly created
global variable 'lastTurn'.

To-Do: Create a play_game function that drives until it finds the box, waits for 2 seconds then returns to the line and turns back in the same direction.

Thoughts: Should we make the line-following its own function so it can be called for each scenario?
